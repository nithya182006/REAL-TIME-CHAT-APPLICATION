 I developed a Real-Time Chat Application that enables users to send and receive messages instantly in both private and group chat settings. The application features a responsive user interface built with modern frontend technologies such as React.js and Tailwind CSS. For real-time communication, I integrated WebSockets using Socket.IO, allowing instant message delivery, live typing indicators, and active user status updates. On the backend, I used Node.js with Express.js to build RESTful APIs for user management and chat operations. All messages, chat history, and user data are stored securely in a MongoDB database, ensuring data persistence and efficient retrieval. I also implemented user authentication using JWT tokens to protect user sessions. This project showcases my ability to build scalable, interactive, and secure web applications with real-time features.
